    "text": "Hello..!!\nI‚Äôm Pablo. I am an enthusiastic Statistics educator and StatEd researcher. I love anything related to teaching and learning statistics (or as people in the wild call it: data science). I truly enjoy discussing stats with people from other fields, especially medical-related  and cognitive-related  fields. I am also passionate about scientific divulgation and breaking down ‚Äúcomplicated processes‚Äù into simple pieces so anyone can digest them. Knowledge should be accessible to anyone. My attention span is limited, that is why I am involved in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Gosh, I forgot what I was going to say.\nAnyway, I am working hard so I can foster good students, awesome researchers, and outstanding data-thinkers.\nI am very lucky to be surrounded, at this stage in my life, with people who bear my not-at-all-brilliant questions and are willing to discuss, virtually anything. These awesome people are, mostly, in the Quantitative Methods in Education program and the Psychological foundations of education program.\nNose around my website to learn more‚Ä¶.You might find something interesting ü§î.\nLast updated: 2023-10-17"
