There, I have TAed and taught a variety of courses ranging from basic stats to mathematical statistics. Some of them are:\n\nXS-0215: Biostatistics [Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022]\nXS-1110: Introduction to Statistics I [Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2022]\nXS-1130: Introduction to Statistics II [Fall 2019, Fall 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2021]\nXS-2330: Continuous Probabilistic Models [Fall 2021]\nXS-3150: Statistical Principles for the Design of Experiments I [Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2022]\nXS-3170: Applied Statistics for Experimental Designs [Fall 2020, Fall 2021, Fall 2022]\nXS-3310: Theory of Statistics [Spring 2022]\n\nAt the U of M I TAed for a term and I am currently the instructor of:\n\nEPSY-3264: Basic and Applied Statistics [Spring 2022, Fall 2023]\n\nFor more details, check my CV."

I am studying under a Fulbright scholarship.\nFor my master degree research, I am analyzing some of the psychometrics properties of the third version of the Statistics Teacher Inventory (STI), a survey designed to collect information on teaching practices of introductory statistics instructors in a variety of institutions and departments across the United States post-secondary education system, so we can 1) create a better understanding of the instrument itself, 2) improve the instrument for latter versions, and 3) analyze the relationship between the latent constructs measured by the STI and the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE).\nI am also doing research with some cool research groups. These are: Lab Advancing Statistics Education Research (LASER)1, Minnesota Youth Development Research Group (MyDrG), Development, Affective Neuroscience, Culture and Environment (DANCE)2.\nOverall, I like to get involved in all the stages (from planning to monitoring, and, the most fun part, performing statistical analysis) of research that, primarily, seeks to answer questions that may have a positive impact in educational settings. My research interests can be summarized into:\n\nTeaching and learning of Statistics\nMeasurement on statistics education research\nStatistics learning trajectories\nStatistical reasoning\n\nI want to continue my formal education through a PhD program that helps me answer some of the following questions:\n\nWhat is the state of teaching and learning statistics in Latin American countries at the undergraduate level?\n\nHow do Latin American students learn statistics?\nHow do Latin American statistics educators teach statistics?\nHow can GAISE provide, if at all, an useful framework to teach and learn statistics in Latin American countries?\n\nHow students most effectively learn and communicate statistical information through text?\n\nHow natural language processing can help the statistics learning process?\nWhich factors can influence students‚Äô ability to learn complex statistical concepts from text?\n\nHow does a statistic learning trajectory look like in a introductory Bayesian class?"

    "text": "Pura Ciencia Tica1 (hereinafter referred to as PCT) is a scientific divulgation project which aims to communicate to a broader community, the results of the high-quality research conducted by brilliant Costa Rican researcher and scientists in a variety of fields.\nEmily Espinoza and Pablo Vivas, creators of the projects, are sons of the Costa Rican public educational system. They had to rely on public funding, such as scholarships, to continue their education from elementary school to college. After several years of studying, they recognized the importance of making scientific knowledge accessible to the public.\nBy interviews with the researchers, round tables, podcasts, tiktoks and other multimedia materials, PCT tries to break down complex concepts into easily digestible parts for the general public. This not only promotes the understanding of scientific advancements but also highlights the dedication and passion of Costa Rican scientists and researchers. The platform also aims to serve as an inspiration for young Costa Ricans, demonstrating that with determination and the right support, they can also contribute to the global scientific community in a variety of fields.\nEmily Espinoza and Pablo Vivas believe that by bridging the gap between researchers and the general public, PCT can foster a culture of curiosity, innovation, and appreciation for science in Costa Rica. Their journey, from beneficiaries of the public education system to advocates for scientific divulgation, is a testament to the transformative power of knowledge and the potential it holds for future generations.\nIt is worth mentioning that PCT is still under development. However, both Emily and Pablo are happy and eager to see it grow and evolve. They understand that building a platform of this magnitude requires time, effort, and continuous adaptation to the ever-changing landscape of science and technology.\nAny comment or suggestion would be very much appreciated.

I love anything related to teaching and learning statistics (or as people in the wild call it: data science). I truly enjoy discussing stats with people from other fields, especially medical-related  and cognitive-related  fields. I am also passionate about scientific divulgation and breaking down ‚Äúcomplicated processes‚Äù into simple pieces so anyone can digest them. Knowledge should be accessible to anyone. My attention span is limited, that is why I am involved in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Gosh.!! I forgot what I was going to say.\nAnyway, I am working hard so I can foster good students, awesome researchers, and outstanding data-thinkers.\nI am very lucky to be surrounded, at this stage in my life, with people who bear my not-at-all-brilliant questions and are willing to discuss, virtually anything. These awesome people are, mostly, in the Quantitative Methods in Education program and the Psychological foundations of education program.\nNose around my website to learn more‚Ä¶.You might find something interesting ü§î.

In the past, I have read several sections of this book, even chapters, but never in a linear and tidy way (this is a constant in many aspects of my life). So, I think that creating a small summary of each chapter with my own word can be beneficial to start thinking about cause-effect research. I wonder this can be implemented in a classroom. Also, I need to deeply understand the \\(do\\) operator so expressions like \\(P(L|do(D))\\) like the one in the introduction really makes sense."
