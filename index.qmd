### Hello..!!

I'm Pablo. I am an enthusiastic Statistics educator and StatEd[^1] researcher. I love everything related to teaching and learning statistics (or as people in the wild call it: *data science*). I truly enjoy discussing stats with people from other fields, especially medical-related {{< fa stethoscope >}} and cognitive-related {{< fa brain >}} fields. I am also passionate about scientific divulgation and breaking down "complicated processes" into simple pieces so anyone can digest them. 

<!-- Anyway, I am working hard so I can foster good students, awesome researchers, and outstanding data-thinkers.  -->

<!-- I am very lucky to be surrounded, at this stage in my life, with people who bear my not-at-all-brilliant questions and are willing to discuss, virtually anything. These awesome people are, mostly, in the [Quantitative Methods in Education](https://edpsych.umn.edu/academics/quantitative-methods) program and the [Psychological foundations of education](https://edpsych.umn.edu/academics/foundations) program. -->

Nose around my website to learn more....You might find something interesting ðŸ¤”. Disclaimer: It is still under construction but I will upload several projects and ideas I've worked on.
