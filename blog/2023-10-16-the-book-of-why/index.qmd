# Book review {{< fa book-bookmark >}}

I just bought my own physical copy of [The book of Why](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X) by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. In the past, I have read several sections of this book, even whole chapters, but never in a linear and *tidy* way (this is a constant in many aspects of my life). So, I think that creating a small summary of each chapter with my own word, and making it really informal, can be beneficial to start thinking about cause-effect research. I wonder this can be implemented in a classroom. Also, I need to deeply understand the $do$ operator so expressions like $P(L|do(D))$ like the one in the introduction really makes sense.

## Chapter 1: The Ladder of causation
