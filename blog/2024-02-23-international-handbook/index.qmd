# Book {{< fa bookmark >}}

This international handbook of StatEd research has a special place in my heart ðŸ’™. My first semester @ UMN, the StatEd community gathered to review and critique one or more chapters every other week. A year later, it feels right to read it whole once again. A little bit older, a little bit wiser, but with an everlasting passion for the field. As I embark in my PhD journey, I need to come back to my roots every now and then. And this book is that: my roots, my beginning....home.
