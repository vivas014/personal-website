## Finally {{< fa sailboat >}}

After several months thinking about going public, many hours of watching tutorials, and reviewing endless documents in the wild...I've finally decided that it is time to have my own personal website. This is a way to communicate with a broader community as well as an artifact to become tidier in the presentation of my thoughts.

Also, and perhaps the most important fact, I will be forced to write. Writing has never been my strongest suit. It doesn't matter if it is English, Spanish or Portuguese, my writing skills have always haunted me. So, what is the best way to get better at something? Of course: practice.

That is why I am willing to make mistakes, to make typos, to put myself into this uncomfortable situation. What is the worst that can happen? üßë‚Äçüíª
